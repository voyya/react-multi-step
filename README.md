## Installation

The package can be installed via NPM:

```
npm install react-multi-step --save
```


```js

```

## Configuration

The most basic use of the multi-step can be described with:

```js
```

## Local Development

The `master` branch contains the latest version of the multi-step component. To start your example app, you can run `yarn start`. This starts a simple webserver on http://localhost:8080.

You can run `yarn test` to execute the test suite and linters. To help you develop the component we’ve set up some tests that covers the basic functionality (can be found in  `/tests`). Even though we’re big fans of testing, this only covers a small piece of the component. We highly recommend you add tests when you’re adding new functionality.

### The examples
The examples are hosted within the docs folder and are ran in the simple add that loads the multi-step. To extend the examples with a new example, you can simply duplicate one of the existing examples and change the unique properties of your example.
